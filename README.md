# 🌟 Simple Landing Page 🌟

Welcome to the **Simple Landing Page** project! 🚀 This is a responsive and user-friendly landing page designed with modern CSS techniques, including **flexbox**, **media queries**, and **viewport-based units**. 🎨

## 📜 Project Overview

This landing page is built to be fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly between desktop and mobile devices. It includes sections such as an introductory header, a pricing area, and a "buy" button, all of which are styled to look great on any screen size.
